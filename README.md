# Introduction
According to the Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD) [1], there are 360 million deaf people worldwide. Another report by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] bumps up the number to 466 million people or over 6% of the world's population suffering from disabling hearing loss. Approximately 70 million people around the world are deaf-mute. While translation services have
become easily accessible for about 100 languages, sign language is still an area that has not been explored. Our goal is to detect & translate the letters of ASL in real-time.
